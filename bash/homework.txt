0. Try all the commands that are on the slides. 
1. Try changing your "bash prompt" using the shell variable PS1 by
    $ export PS1=' $ '
2. In bash, lookup how to have more useful info within the prompt (like time,
   current-directory, username, servername)
3. Change from one directory to another using .. and . and using absolute
path.
4. Try touching an existing file and see if that file's timestamp changes.
    (See timestamp using "ls -l")
5. When using rm, to see which option is more important: -i and -f (one is 
    interactive, other is force) by aliasing rm to rm -i, and then using -f
    option. Try viceversa (aliasing to rm -f and then using -i option).
    Be sure to be in a directory without important contents.

6. Use both rmdir and rm -r for a directory with and w/o conents.
7. Try finding option of cp that RETAINS the original file's timestamp.
   Try using cp without this option. Find timestamp differences.

8. Try command "which ls" or "which any-command", and "which which".
9. Try changing permissions of some file and try overwriting it, or editing
it.
   (Simplest way to edit it is to *append* to that file by using ">>". For
example:
      $ ls > new_file # Hash is a comment, > means create-and-write (or
overwrite-if-exists).
      $ cat new_file # to see the contents. (Or try less new_file)
      $ ls >> new_file # this is to *append* to the bottom.
   (Whatever typed after # is a comment: this is BASH syntax. No need to type
for you.)

10. See what is "chmod 644 filename.txt". (optional)
11. Try less filename.txt (for a file that is there.)
    Try less and also more for images, pdf-files, ps files.

12. Try wc filename.txt, and also wc -l filename.txt, and then wc -l file1.txt
file2.txt file3.txt
     (for existing files!)
13. Use head and/or tail for all lines EXCEPT first 10 lines, for last 10
lines,
    just first 10 lines, etc., for 20th to 30th lines (including both 20 and
30).

14. Try alias and unalias commands.
15. Try copying a file using cp, but also RETAINING the timestamp of the
original file.
